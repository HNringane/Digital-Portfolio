**S â€“ Situation:**  
As a final-year ICT student, I was tasked with leading the backend development of a student registration system for our practical project.

**T â€“ Task:**  
I had to design, code, and document the logic for storing and retrieving student records securely.

**A â€“ Action:**  
I used Python and SQLite for database operations, created API-style functions, and implemented input validation. I also coordinated with my group to integrate the frontend and backend.

**R â€“ Result:**  
The project was delivered successfully, meeting the brief and running without critical errors. It improved my skills in back-end development, documentation, and real-world teamwork under academic pressure.
